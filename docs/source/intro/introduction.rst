Introduction of DIG: Dive into Graphs
======

DIG includes unified implementations of **data interfaces**, **common algorithms**, and **evaluation metrics** for several advanced tasks. Our goal is to enable researchers to easily implement and benchmark algorithms. Currently, we consider the following research directions.

* **Graph Generation**: :obj:`dig.ggraph`
* **Self-supervised Learning on Graphs**: :obj:`dig.sslgraph`
* **Explainability of Graph Neural Networks**: :obj:`dig.xgraph`
* **Deep Learning on 3D Graphs**: :obj:`dig.3dgraph`

You can refer to `benchmark implementations <https://github.com/divelab/DIG/tree/dig/benchmarks>`_ as examples to use APIs provided in DIG.
