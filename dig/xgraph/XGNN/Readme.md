# XGNN

This repository provides the code for our paper [XGNN: Towards Model-Level Explanations of Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02587) accepted by KDD-2020. 

Our proposed XGNN algorithm aims at providing model-level explanations for Graph Neural Networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study the model-level explanations of Graph Neural Networks.
