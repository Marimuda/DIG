# The generic 3DGN framework

## Functions need implemented: three ɸ functions and six ρ functions.
### ɸ functions:
update functions, applied to nodes, edges, or the whole graph as information update functions for the corresponding geometries.
### ρ functions:
aggreagation functions, used to aggregate information from one type of geometry to another.
